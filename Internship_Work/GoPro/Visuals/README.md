**Total Cost vs. Media Value Visual:**  
Graph comparing the total cost of an event and the estimated media value gained. Both axes are log-scaled to help visualize the wide range of event sizes and returns. The dashed 45° line (slope = 1) represents where an event’s media value equals its cost. So, events above the line delivered positive ROI, generating more media value than they cost while events below the line delivered negative ROI.

**Efficiency vs. Impact:**  
Graph visualizing event performance by comparing efficiency (CPM - cost per 1,000 impressions) versus Impact (total impressions generated). The plot is log-scaled on the y-axis to account for the extreme variation in audience reach across events. 

The vertical red line at CPM = 10 separates efficient (right) from inefficient (left) events, and the horizontal blue line at 1,250,000 impressions separates high-impact (above) from low-impact (below) events.  The resulting quadrants reflect how we decided to classify the ROI profiles of the events.
