GoPro is an action sports camera company that creates innovative cameras and accessories designed for capturing high-quality footage in any environment. I worked for a team there as a Data Analyst, collecting data on the company's event and influencer sponsorship media to create a dataset for analysis. After gathering the data, our goal was to develop an ROI formula by identifying correlations among the collected metrics to determine which types of events generated the highest returns. We then finalized a report to help guide the company's sponsorship decisions for the following year.
Attached are the visuals I created for the final report
