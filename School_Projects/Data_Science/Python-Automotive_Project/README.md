This project analyzes automotive stock data from 2010–2025 to determine whether certain companies show predictable seasonal patterns and whether stock price behavior can be used to group companies.

The project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, machine learning (KNN + K-Means), model evaluation, and visualization using Python pandas and scikit-learn.
