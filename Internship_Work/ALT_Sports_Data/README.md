ALT Sports Data is a data and analytics company that partners with sports leagues and betting platforms to create real-time betting markets and insights but with their focus being around the alternative and action sports industry. I primarily focused on improving their predictive model for the surf industry, researching whether a correlation exists between a surfer's score and the contest location and what the cause of this correlation stems from. Using R Studio, I applied statistical and computer science methods to manipulate the data, identify correlations, and create a comprehensive report featuring visualizations and tables to present my findings.
